Digital Math represents digitalization of mathematics, society, industry and society in the form of automated and easily understandable computation of mathematical models in the Open Source FEniCS framework with world-leading performance and recognized at the highest level of science and industry together with an effective pedagogical concept with combined abstract theory and mathematical interactive programming in a cloud-HPC web-interface.  
  
With our computational framework you can predict and understand the grand challenges of science and technology.
